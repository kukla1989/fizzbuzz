  ## Project Setup

This project provides a simple FizzBuzz implementation using TypeScript and HTML. Follow the instructions below to set up the project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

### Development

1. Install the required dependencies.

2. Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode to automatically compile the TypeScript code.

   ```bash
   npx tsc app.ts --outDir dist --watch
   ```

   This command will compile the `app.ts` file and watch for any changes, recompiling the code as needed.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the FizzBuzz application.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed.
